![Dashboard Preview](Valorant_Dashboard.png)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project showcases  **VCT Kickoff 2025 statistics** across all regions.  
The dataset was collected via a **Python web scraping program**, processed, cleaned and visualized to provide insights into **player performance, map dynamics, and side win rates**.

## 📊 Dashboard Features  
- **Player Statistics**  
  - Kills, Deaths, Assists (K/D/A)  
  - Kill/Death Ratio (KD)  
  - Average Combat Score (ACS)  
  - Maps Played  

- **Map Insights**  
  - Attack vs Defense side win percentage  
  - Map-specific win rates (Abyss, Haven, Split, Bind, Lotus, Fracture, Pearl)  

- **Agent Selection**  
  - Breakdown of agent usage (Sage, Killjoy, Skye, etc.)  
  - Agent performance contribution  

- **Interactive Filters**  
  - Filter by player, map, or agent to view custom insights.
